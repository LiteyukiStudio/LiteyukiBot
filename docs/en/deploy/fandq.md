## **Frequently Asked Questions**

- There are too many python interpreters on my computer, how do I know which one to use?
    - You can specify which python interpreter to use by using the full path to the python executable, for example, `/path/to/python main.py`
    - Use virtual environments to avoid conflicts between different python interpreters

- Update Liteyuki failed, error `InvalidGitRepositoryError`
    - Please install `Git` correctly and deploy Liteyuki using cloning instead of direct download

- How to log in to chat platforms?
    - Some plugins provide the ability to log in to specific platforms, for example, using the NoneBot plugin to log in to supported adapter platforms

- `Playwright` installation failed
    - Enter `playwright install` to install the browser

- Some plugins report errors after installation and cannot be started
    - Please refer to the plugin documentation first, confirm that the necessary configuration items of the plugin are intact, 
      and if the problem persists, please contact the plugin author or start Liteyuki in safe mode `safe_mode: true`.
